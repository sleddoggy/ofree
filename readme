An alternative to 'free' for use in OpenVZ containers with recent kernels
(2.6.32-042stab102.9 and later) that show incorrect memory reporting with 
the 'free' utility.

This issue seems to affect Debian 7 & Ubuntu 12.04 and later OS versions.

About
-----

For OpenVZ containers ONLY.

This is a Bash script. It performs memory calculations based on the values in
/proc/user_beancounters. Swap usage is read from /proc/meminfo.

As the user_beancounters file is accessible only by root, this script must be
run by root or via sudo.


Installation
------------

[root@vps ~] cd /usr/bin
[root@vps /usr/bin] wget https://github.com/sleddoggy/ofree/raw/master/ofree
[root@vps /usr/bin] chmod 700 ofree
